## SharkTanks - Join the battle, forge your destiny.

Welcome to SharkTanks! It is an online multiplayer game that allows multiple players to play together over the internet with each other. Even if there is no one around to play, we have implemented a bot that can work as an additional player. This game is open-sourced, so feel free to create issues to add features or fix bugs. If you find the project interesting, please consider giving it a star!

### Inspiration
We were inspired to build an online multiplayer game because we are fans of video games and the idea of being able to play with others from across the world really excites us.

### Technologies Used
We used the following technologies to build the game:

- HTML and CSS for the landing page
- Three.js, Express.js and Node.js for the game environment and the backend
- Railway.app for hosting
- Socket.io for the real time communication between the players and the server

### Challenges Faced
We encountered a few challenges while building the game. Some of them are listed below:

- Network Latency: In the beginning, we were using rendered tanks which caused a lot of lag in the gameplay.
- Server Scalability: As more players joined the game, the game server was overloaded and unable to handle the increased traffic. This caused a decrease in performance and a bad user experience.
- Page Overrides: The index page was being overridden by the canvas of the game, and we had to make a few changes in the particular layouts to avoid this.
- Function Workability: The function for counting the hits so that the damage on the tank could be noted was not working properly, but we performed a few debug techniques and fixed it.

### Future Plans
There are several evolutionary changes planned for SharkTank, such as:

- Adding rendered objects to make it look better
- Giving rendered objects functionality, for example, moving, transforming, etc.
- Implementing and improving security aspects
- Assigning separate user accounts so that players can keep track of their achievements and develop their ability accordingly.
- Changing environments and much more
