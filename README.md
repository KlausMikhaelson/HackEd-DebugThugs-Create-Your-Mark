## Project Name
SharkTanks - Join the battle, forge your destiny.

## Inspiration
We were inspired to build an online multiplayer game because we all have always been a fan of video games and the idea of being able to play with others from across the world and it really excites us. 

## What it does
It is a type of video game that allows multiple players to play together over the internet with each other. Also even if there is no one around to play we have also implemented a bot that can work as an additional player.
 
## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS for the landing page, Three.js, Express.js and Node.js for the game environment and all other controls; Railway. app as a host and socket.io as a client-server interaction tool.

## Challenges we ran into
**To be honest, there were many challenges that we ran into some of them are as follows:-**
- Network Latency: In the beginning, we were using the rendered tanks and because of that same there was a lot of lag in the gameplay.
- Server scalability: As more players were joining the game, the game server was overloaded and unable to handle the increased traffic. which was again causing a decrease in performance and causing a bad user experience.
- Page overrides: The index page was being overridden by the canvas of the game and in order to avoid that we have to make a few changes in the particular layouts.
- Function Workability: The particular function for counting the hit so that, the damage on the tank can be noted was not working properly, but we performed a few debug techniques and got it fixed.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**“Impossible is just an opinion.” —Paulo Coelho** 
We were able to learn many things and implement them in under 24 hrs which is an accomplishment in itself.

## What we learned
“Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.” ― Mahatma Gandhi
 We learned how to build an online multiplayer game with working functionality and host it on the server so that it is accessible to other online players as well!

## What's next for SharkTanks-Debug_Thugs 
**"The only thing constant in life is change." - Francis Bacon**
_There are several evolutionary changes for SharkTank that we have staged. _
- We are planning to add rendered objects to make it look better
- Secondly, that rendered objects can be given functionality for example moving, transforming etc.
- Thirdly, security aspects can be implemented and also improved
- Separate user accounts can be assigned so that they can keep track of their achievements and develop their ability accordingly.
- Environments can be change and many more to come.....
